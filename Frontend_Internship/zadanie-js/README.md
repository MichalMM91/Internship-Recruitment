# JS Script


It's a repo with the code challenge I took up to participate in a software house FED Internship Recruitment.

The script uses fetch method to send a request to the server and recieve a promise containing a response (JSON file).
There are several functions that can be executed on a key-value object.

**_compare_** function is implemented in order to enable sorting for methods below.

---
## _sortUpvotes()_
Sorts object elements by upvotes incrementally. Result is printed.

---
## _sortNumComments()_
Sorts object elements by number of comments incrementally. Result is printed.

---
## _sortScore()_
Sorts object elements by score incrementally. Result is printed.

---
## _sortCreated()_
Sorts object elements by date incrementally. Date is converted from an epoch to human readable date. Result is printed.

---
## _isOlderThan()_
Using conditional operator, the function enables evaluation of which posts were made earlier than 24h ago.

---
## _getNewestPosts()_
Evaluates using _isOlderThan()_ method which posts were made earlier than 24h ago and pushes them into empty array. Result is printed.
